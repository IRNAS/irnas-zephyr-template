# This is a default makefile for the Zephyr project, that is supposed to be 
# initialized with West and built with East. 
#
# This makefile in combination with the Github actions does the following:
# * Installs python dependencies and toolchain
# * Initializes the project with West and updates it
# * Runs east release
# If the _build_ is running due to the release creation, then the following also 
# happens:
# * Creates 'artefacts' folder,
# * Copies release zip files and extra release notes files into it.
#
# Downloaded West modules, toolchain and nrfutil-toolchain-manager are cached in 
# CI after the first time the entire build is run.
#
# The assumed precondition is that the repo was setup with below commands:
# mkdir -p <project_name>/project
# cd <project_name>/project
# git clone <project_url> .
#
# Every target assumes that is run from the repo's root directory, which is 
# <project_name>/project.
