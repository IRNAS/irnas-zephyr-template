#
# This script is used to compare the analysis results of given build directories
# against the analysis results stored on the codechecker server.
#
# Precondition:
# - The codechecker server is running and EAST_CODECHECKER_SERVER_URL
#   environment variable contains its url. This is expected by the
#   `east codechecker servdiff` command.
# - The codechecker client is installed and logged in to the codechecker server.
# - Given build directories were analyzed with east codechecker check command
#
# Script will then compare the analysis results of each build directory against
# the analysis results on the server and store the diff in codechecker-diffs
# directory. If any reports are detected, the script will exit with error code
# 1, otherwise 0.
